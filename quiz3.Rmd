## Quiz 3


```{r load}
library(SummarizedExperiment)
library(Biobase)
library(GenomicRanges)
library(broom)
library(limma)
library(dplyr)
library(snpStats)
```

Question 1

Load the example SNP data with the following code:

```{r}
data(for.exercise)
use <- seq(1, ncol(snps.10), 10)
sub.10 <- snps.10[,use]
snpdata = sub.10@.Data
status = subject.support$cc
```


Fit a linear model and a logistic regression model to the data for the 3rd SNP. What are the coefficients for the SNP variable? How are they interpreted? (Hint: Don't forget to recode the 0 values to NA for the SNP data)

```{r}
snp3 = snpdata[,3]
lm(status ~ snp3) #these dimensions would line up. Do I need a dataframe? 
```
